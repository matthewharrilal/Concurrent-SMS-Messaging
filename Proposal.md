##### Why this idea kept my attention on a close grip?

Before coming up with the idea I was heavily interested in the idea of concurrency in real world contexts and how that can be applied to existing applications! Also have been building numerous socket based project before the intersection of communication and concurrency is the theme of this project!

Tower Flow allows users to be able to deliver messages to a group of users concurrently! Usually an approach to sending messages to a group of users "simultaneously" you would store them in a centralized place such as a group chat. Tower Flow differs by allowing these users to have no correlation other than the grouping of numbers the message is outgoing to. 

##### Application of this utility?

Thanks to Droxey for the idea of how this service can be applied is through the use of a broadcasting system. Being able to send messages to users "simultaneously" in order to deliver a common message!

Other variations of a broadcasting based application are a teacher -> students communication system!
