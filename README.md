# Tower Flow ‚ö°Ô∏è
Tower flow enables users to be able to message individual users **concurrently** üì≤. Built upon Twillio SMS API and utilizing [GORM](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm) (Go Object Relational Mapper) to persist data, this was and is an example of understanding concurrency in a real world context!

### Prerequisites
In order to **interact** with the Twillio API to send messages you will need proper authentication credentials üëÆ, **Account SID** and and **Authentication Token**.

Navigate over to the [Twillio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) and create an application with SMS messaging üì≤!

Once doing so you should now have been issued an **authentication token** and **account sid** number. It should look a bit like this üî•!

**HIGHLY suggest** once you have obtained these credentials to place them in a **.env** file and stored in a **git ignore**. 

Once added SMS capabilities to your application on Twillio you should have received a telephone number that will act as the source of all outgoing messages! If you did not receive one navigate to phone numbers [section](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) of the Twillio console.

### Installing
To install Tower Flow execute this command
 **_go get https://github.com/matthewharrilal/Concurrent-SMS-Messaging_**

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
